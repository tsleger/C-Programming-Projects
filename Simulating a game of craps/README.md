C Program which simulates a game of craps.

Craps is a game played with 2 dice. If you roll 7 or 11 on the first roll you win. If you roll 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll you lose. Any other roll is called the "point" and the game continues. Now the player wins if on any subsequent roll the player rolls "point" again. However if the player rolls a 7 before rolling the "point" then the player loses. Any other roll (aside from "point" or 7) is ignored and we continue rolling until we hit "point" or 7.
